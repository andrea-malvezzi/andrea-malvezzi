# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea

I build tools to make my life easier, then share them with the community. Sometimes I also make websites to solve common problems.

## 🔧 Obsidian Plugins

  - Coming soon
- **[Smart LaTeX]()** - Fast shortcuts for math and LaTeX note-taking, built mostly for STEM students
  - Coming soon

## 🌐 Websites
- **[Is It Crossplay?](https://iscrossplay.com)** - Check if your favorite games support cross-play and cross-progression across platforms

## 👨‍💻 Boring Stuff (About Me)
CS student in Bologna, Italy. When I'm not automating mundane tasks, I'm gaming, listening to music, or playing volleyball with friends.
