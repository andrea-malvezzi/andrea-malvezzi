- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andrea-malvezzi;
- ðŸŽ“ Currently studying Computer Science in University (Alma Mater Studiorum in Bologna, in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹);
- I LOVE making small projects in the free time, such as my (infinitely loading website)[https://andrea-malvezzi.github.io/infinite-loading-website/] and my simple svelte-based [to-do app](https://andrea-malvezzi.github.io/my-todo-app/)...
- ... but I also enjoy creating some more complete websites from time to time, such as my ðŸŽ®[gaming blog](https://www.thegaminglair.com)!
